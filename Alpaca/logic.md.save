# Review of Logic:
This is ment as a page to look at if you need a refresher on logic
or if you need some more resources.
## Prepisontional logic:
1) A preposition is a statement that is either true or false.
	ex: 'the sky is blue'

2) We can tie prepositions together with logical operators:
	ex: 'the sky is blue' and 'the ocean is blue'

3) There are 5 main logical operators
And (A), or (V), negation (~), implies (->), bi-conditional (<=>)

And : both statements it connects have to be true for the entire statement to be true

Or : At least one of the statements have to be true for the entire statement to be true

Negation : The statement it is attached to has the oposite truth value

Implies : If the first statement is true, the second statment has to be true for the 
whole statement to be true. Otherwise the statement is true

Bi-Conitional : the two statements have to have the same truth value to be true

## Truth table
1) A truth table is a way of representing all possible truth values of a prepositional statement  
	ex: A and B
	A | B | A and B
	---------------
	T | T | T
	T | F | F
	F | T | F
	F | F | F

## Functional completeness
Functional complete means that all possible truth tables can be made.
List of functionally complete operators:
	1) And, negation
	2) Or, negation
	3) implies, negation
