Last Week:

Last week I refreshed on python, and got familiar with the framework
the project would be using: kivy. I spent alot of time looking at documentation for kivy
before jumping into writing some code for the project. I also laid out a rough timeline 
for when certain featues should be finished by. I then divided the team into more efficient
groups and assigned each group a feature as well as a rough deadline for each group. I also 
spent some time helping others in the group to install and get familiar with kivy.

This Week:
I started work on the project, creating a rough gui with the other members
on my team. We also came up with some ideas for how the gui should look as
well as storyboarding some animations we would use for the project. I am also
currently working a better homepage for the gui.
